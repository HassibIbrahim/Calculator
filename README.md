A simple arithmetic function calculator by Ibrahim Hassib.
It allows a user to select the arithmetic function set to be perfomed on two numbers.
User inputs the first number then the second number on the empty slot.
User clicks submit to pop up an alert box with the outcome.
This was built to showcase equivalent jquery fuctions on the javascript library.
